## Realtime: a dishonest client can keep receiving a channel after removal

**Where:** `backend/app/Broadcasting/ReverbBroadcaster.php`,
`backend/app/Listeners/TerminateRevokedConnections.php`, `backend/routes/channels.php`.

**How revocation normally works.** `channel.{id}` is authorized live from channel membership. Each private-channel
authorization signs `channel_data = {"user_id": …}` into the subscription. When a member leaves or is removed,
`MemberRemoved` (after commit) calls Reverb's `POST /apps/{app}/users/{user}/terminate_connections`. That call
closes every socket that has a subscription tagged with that user id. The client reconnects, and its new
authorization request for the channel is refused.

**The attack.** A modified client, while it is still a member:

1. opens a second WebSocket, B, and subscribes it to nothing, so it carries no user id;
2. calls `POST /broadcasting/auth` with B's `socket_id` and `private-channel.{id}` and keeps the signature
   without using it. The signature is valid for that `(socket_id, channel, channel_data)` forever, because
   Pusher-protocol signatures do not expire.

After it is removed, the termination closes only the sockets tagged with its user id, so B survives. The client
then sends `pusher:subscribe` on B with the stored signature. Reverb only checks the HMAC, so it accepts, and B
receives the channel's events until it disconnects.

**Why it is accepted for v1:**

- It needs a deliberately modified client and a decision to prepare *before* the removal.
- Only events sent after the removal leak: new messages, edits and reactions. It gives no write access, no REST
  access (every API route checks membership on each request), and no history beyond what the member could
  already read.
- The surviving socket is lost on any disconnect: network change, Reverb restart, or deploy.
- The v1 deployment is a single small workspace.

**Intended fix (later): channel key rotation plus a per-user rekey channel.**

- Broadcast each channel on a versioned name, `channel.{id}.{epoch}`, with `epoch` stored on the channel and
  incremented on every removal or leave. A signature fetched for an older epoch then subscribes to a name nobody
  broadcasts on any more.
- Tell the remaining members about the new epoch on their own private channel, `user.{id}` (the "rekey"
  channel). Their clients then re-authorize and subscribe to the new name.
- Authorization for `channel.{id}.{epoch}` requires current membership *and* the current epoch.
- An alternative with the same shape is end-to-end encrypted channels (`private-encrypted-`) with a per-epoch
  shared secret.
